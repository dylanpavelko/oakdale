			We would like to acknowledge the land we live on which was ___ from the Gabrieleño (also known as <a href="https://gabrielenoindians.org/" target="_blank">Kizh</a>, <a href="http://gabrielino-tongva.com/" target="_blank">Tongva</a>) Tataviam, and Chumash tribes. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The Gabrieleño and Chumash had an extensive trade network utilizing boats.
		</p>
		<p>
			The people of this land have a rich history of living here for milleniums. (ADD ANY FACTS ABOUT EARLIEST RECORDS) Much of this history and culture has been lost during colonization in the 1700's when the indigenous people were ________ by Spaniards. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1769 Spain's Graspar de Portola land expedition led to the founding of Mission San Gabriel by Christian Missionary Junipero Serra in 1771 and initiated an era of forced reolcation, enslavement, and exposure to disease.

		</p>
			In 1821 Mexico gained its independence from Spain 

			After the the Mexican-American War California was ceded to the United States in 1848, at which time treaties were signed (but never ratified) by the government with people who did not represent the tribes of have the authority to cede their land in exchange for promising 8.5% of the land (of the 100 million acres in California) for indian reservations.

			The land was formally taken as part of the Land Cession 286 on June 10, 1851. The cession was to reserve a tract of land between Tejon pass and Kern river. Many tribes weren't recognized in the cessation.
		</p>
		<p>
			As an example of the impact.
		</p>
		<p>
			The name of the tribe Kizh (pronounced Keech) comes from the dome like dwellings they lived in, primarily along the rivers made of willow branches. They were first known by the Spanish as Kichireños "people of the willowhouse" and were the people who canoed out to greet Spanish explorer Juan Rodriquez Cabrillo upon his arrival off the shores of Santa Catalina and San Pedro in 1542. Cabrillo declined their invitation to come ashore and visit.
		</p>
		<p>
			Their original tribe name was lost through assimilation into Spanish culture, and they came to be called Gabrieleño and Fernandeño because of their forced labor with the San Gabriel Mission and San Fernando Mission. Gabrieleño's also primarily identified with their village as opposed to a larger tribe, which is largely lost due to their oral history being largely lost to time. Topanga was the site of one these villages. 
		</p>
		<p>
			An example of the harm done to these people through colonization and forced relocation is the challenge to identify with a specific tribe. There is some controversy within the community around the name of the tribe with some associating with the tribe name of Tongva which has become the more prominent used name in academic papers. Those who identify with being a part of the Kizh nation assert that Tongva was a name first used in the early 1900's and was only recently promoted in the 1980's and 1990's to help advanced political legislation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of this disagreement in name, the term Gabrieleño has been used as a mediating term despite it enver beeing a name these people used to refer to themselves.
