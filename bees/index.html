		<blockquote>
			<p>Overturning a 136-year-old ban, the Los Angeles City Council voted on Wednesday to legalize urban beekeeping.</p>
			<p>Los Angeles will join cities including New York, San Francisco and Washington in allowing beekeeping. There is even a beehive on the White House grounds.</p>
			<p>The ordinance will limit beekeeping to backyards of single family homes and establish buffer zones, and beekeepers will have to provide a source of water at their hives.</p>

		<strong>Requirements for Backyard Beekeeping</strong><br/>
		<ul>
			<li>The person who is the owner of or in possession of an apiary is registered as a beekeeper with the County of <a href="https://acwm.lacounty.gov/bees-in-our-environment/">Los Angeles Agricultural Commission</a></li>
			<li>The number of hives is limited to one for every 2,500 square feet of lot area.</li>
			<li>Hives are not located in the required front yard of a lot, including through lots.</li>
			<li>Hives are located a minimum of five feet from the front, side, and rear lot lines and a minimum of 20 feet from public rights-of-way or private streets.</li>
			<li>Hive entrances face away from, or parallel to, the nearest lot line adjacent to another lot.</li>
			<li>A six-foot wall, fence, or hedge is located between hives and adjacent lots, or hives are placed at a minimum of eight feet above ground level of the adjacent lot. The purpose of this provision is to provide a solid barrier to help direct bees over six feet above ground level when departing the lot to minimize interactions between bees and individuals in the vicinity.</li>
			<li>A water source for bees shall be provided at all times on the property where the bees are kept to discourage bee visitation at swimming pools, hose bibs and other water sources on adjacent public or surrounding property.</li>
		</ul>
